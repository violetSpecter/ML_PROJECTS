## Introduction

Provide a detailed introduction to the project. Explain the problem you are solving, the dataset you are using, and the machine learning techniques you have implemented. Mention the overall objective and scope of the project.

## Features

List key features of your project, such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
- Predictions and visualizations

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to set up the project locally. Include steps to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git

# Change directory to the project folder
cd project-name

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Explain how to use the project. Include examples of how to run the scripts or notebooks to train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions. Provide command-line examples and relevant parameter options.

bash
# Example: Training the model
python train_model.py --data_path "data/dataset.csv" --epochs 50 --batch_size 32


## Data

Describe the dataset used in the project. Include details like the source, format, preprocessing steps, and any data augmentation techniques applied.

## Model Training

Explain the process of training the model, including the algorithms used, hyperparameters, and the training environment. If you used any specific frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn), mention them here.

## Evaluation

Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC). Provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses based on the evaluation results.

## Results

Present the results of your model, including visualizations (graphs, charts) and tables. Summarize the key findings and compare them with baseline models if available.

## Contributing

If you'd like others to contribute to your project, provide guidelines on how they can do so. Include steps for cloning the repository, creating a new branch, and submitting pull requests.

## License

Include the license under which your project is distributed. For example:
